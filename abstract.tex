Measurements of the top quark pair-production cross section and limits on parameters of exotic physical models models using the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider are presented.
The top-quark pair-production cross section is measured to be $177 \pm 11$ pb at a center-of-massm energy of 7 TeV.
%Using a likelihood function that describes single-lepton, dilepton, and all hadronic final states simultaneously, a cross section of $177 \pm 11$ pb at a center-of-mass-energy of 7 TeV is measured.
A lower limit on the mass of a fourth-generation $b'$ quark or a composite $T_{\frac{5}{3}}$ particle is placed at at 0.67 TeV at 95\% confidence level, and an upper limit on the production cross section of four-tops events is placed at 61 fb at 95\% confidence level.
%Using events with same-sign top quark final state topologies, limits are placed on the masses and production cross sections of a number of exotic models.
%A lower limit on the mass of either a fourth-generation $b'$ quark or a composite $T_{\frac{5}{3}}$ particle are placed at 0.67 TeV at 95\% confidence level when produced in pairs.
%When including single production, the limit on the mass of the $T_{\frac{5}{3}}$ is found to be 0.68 TeV or 0.70 TeV at 95\% confidence level for coupling constants on the $t \rightarrow WT_{\frac{5}{3}}$ vertex of 1 and 3, respectively.
