Measurements of the top quark pair-production cross-section at the Large Hadron Collider using the ATLAS experiment are presented.
Using a likelihood function that describes single-lepton, dilepton, and all hadronic final states simultaneously, a cross-section of $177 \pm 11$ pb at a center-of-mass-energy of 7 TeV is measured.
In addition, upper limits on the properties of several exotic models are placed using events with same-sign top quark topologies.
A lower limit on the mass of either a fourth-generation $b'$ quark or a composite $T_{\frac{5}{3}}$ particle are placed at 0.67 TeV at 95\% confidence level when produced in pairs.
When including single production, the limit on the mass of the $T_{\frac{5}{3}}$ is found to be 0.68 TeV or 0.70 TeV at 95\% confidence level for coupling constants on the $tWT\frac{5}{3}$ vertex of 1 and 3, respectively.
Using the same analysis, an upper limit on the production cross-section of four-top events is placed at 61 fb at 95\% confidence level.
%A upper limit is placed on the mass of a  between 0.68 TeV and 0.70 TeV, depending on the assumed strength of the coupling constant.
%A lower limit on the mass of a fourth-generation $b'$ quark is set at 0.67 TeV.
