Measurements of the top quark pair-production cross-section and limits on parameters exotic models made with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider are presented.
Using a likelihood function that describes single-lepton, dilepton, and all hadronic final states simultaneously, a cross-section of $177 \pm 11$ pb at a center-of-mass-energy of 7 TeV is measured.
Using events with same-sign top quark final state topologies, limits are placed on the masses and production cross-sections of exotic models.
A lower limit on the mass of either a fourth-generation $b'$ quark or a composite $T_{\frac{5}{3}}$ particle are placed at 0.67 TeV at 95\% confidence level when produced in pairs.
When including single production, the limit on the mass of the $T_{\frac{5}{3}}$ is found to be 0.68 TeV or 0.70 TeV at 95\% confidence level for coupling constants on the $t \rightarrow WT_{\frac{5}{3}}$ vertex of 1 and 3, respectively.
An upper limit on the production cross-section of four-top events is placed at 61 fb at 95\% confidence level.
