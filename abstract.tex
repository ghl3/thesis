The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics.
The precise measurement of it's properties not only serves as a crucial test of the capibalities of the Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment, but serves as an excellent way to search for Beyond the Standard Model physics.  
Precise measurements of the Top Quark's properties require experimental and statstical techniques.
