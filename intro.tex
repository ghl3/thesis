The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics.
The precise measurement of it's properties not only serves as a crucial test of the capibalities of the Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment, but serves as an excellent way to search for Beyond the Standard Model physics.  
Precise measurements of the Top Quark's properties require experimental and statstical techniques.

This thesis will describe two measurements that can be used to study the standard model and to search for or constrain beyond the standard model physical models or new physics scenerios.
The first measurement is a sophisticated and extremely precise determination of the top quark production cross-section at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV.
The second is a search for final states that resemble the production of two top quarks.
