\chapter{Statement of problem\label{chap:one}}

In this chapter, \ldots

\section{The Riemann Hypothesis\label{sec:hypothesis}}

Blah, blah, blah. There is nothing interesting in
figure~\ref{fig:afigure}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \emph{This statement is false.}
  \end{center}%
\caption[This alternate caption appears in the list of figures.]{This is the
caption that appears under the figure. It may be quite long---you wouldn't want
such a long caption to appear in the ``list of figures''.}
\label{fig:afigure}
\end{figure}

More blah, blah. There is nothing interesting about
table~\ref{tab:atable} either.
\begin{table}[htb]
\caption[Strange rules.]{For some reason unfamiliar to me,
typesetting rules require one to place captions above tables,
but below figures. Go figure.}\label{tab:atable}
  \begin{center}
    \framebox{You could put a table here. I won't.}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Another section\label{sec:two}}

Notice that the fist paragraph is indented. There's a package
to do that automatically. Blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah.
