\section{Same-Sign Top quark production}

\subsection{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) of the electroweak and strong interactions is extremely successful in
explaining most of the measurements in particle physics at energies accessible today. Its
predicted behaviour at higher energies, however, presents some theoretical problems that
have motivated a large number of extensions to the theory. Due to the large
variety of models proposed, signature-based searches are often useful when exploring the
consequences of these theories. In hadron collisions it is useful to
group final states by the number of charged leptons (electrons or muons). Within this
classification, a signal with two leptons of the same electric charge, same-sign
dileptons, is interesting since it has a low background rate in the SM, and
potentially large contributions from new phenomena.

In this note, we present a search for events characterized by two isolated same-sign leptons
in association with at least two jets, including jets arising from $b$ quarks. Three specific signal
processes are considered: pair production of down-type heavy quarks of charge -1/3, denoted $b^\prime$;
single and pair production of heavy top quark partners of charge +5/3, denoted $T_{5/3}$; and
production of events containing four top quarks, i.e. $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$, 
produced via a four-top quark contact interaction.

Apart from single production of the $T_{5/3}$, the final states of the three different
signals contain four $W$ bosons, and each can decay either leptonically or hadronically. 
With four $W$ bosons in the event, many different topologies are possible. A good compromise between
high branching ratio and low background is the topology where two $W$ bosons decay leptonically
and the two other $W$ bosons decay hadronically. Moreover, requiring that the two leptons have the same
electric charge reduces further the level of background processes since very few SM processes 
generate this topology. 

Therefore, in this note, we study the decay channels with two $W$ bosons decaying to leptons (electrons
and muons) of the same electric charge, including contributions from $\tau\rightarrow e$ and
$\tau\rightarrow\mu$. 
The signature will then be two leptons of the same electric charge in addition to missing 
transverse momentum from the neutrinos and several jets. Moreover, among the jets 
of these events, we expect to have at least two jets arising from $b$ quarks, a feature which is
exploited in this search.

The CMS Collaboration searched for fourth-generation down-type heavy quarks in same-sign dilepton
or trilepton events with at least one $b$-tagged jet, and set a lower mass limit at 
611~\GeV{}~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012yea} at 95\% confidence level (C.L.), 
with 4.9~\ifb{} of $pp$ data at $\sqrt{s}=7 \TeV$.
In the same channel, ATLAS published a mass limit of 450~\GeV{}~\cite{Aad:2012bb} at 95\% C.L.
using 1~\ifb{} of data.
The CDF Collaboration searched for the pair production of $T_{5/3}$ in the same-sign dilepton
channel with several jets and missing transverse momentum, and set a lower mass limit at
365~\GeV{}~\cite{Aaltonen:2009nr} at 95\% C.L., with 2.7~\ifb{} of $p\bar{p}$ data.
There is no published result yet on the experimental search for the production 
of events containing four top quarks.

This note is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sect:models} contains a description of the
three signals which are studied in this note. The data and Monte Carlo samples are discussed in
Section~\ref{sect:samples}. The object reconstruction and event selection are described in 
Sections~\ref{sect:objects} and \ref{sect:selection}, respectively. The SM backgrounds,
in particular the data-driven ones, are detailed in Section~\ref{sect:back}. The systematic
uncertainties are discussed in Section~\ref{sect:syst}, before the presentation of the results
in Section~\ref{sect:results}. Finally, the interpretation of these results in the framework of the
three signals is discussed in Section~\ref{sect:interpretation}, before the presentation of the
conclusions in Section~\ref{sect:conclusion}.

\subsection{Signal processes}\label{sect:models}
The three different signal processes considered in this note are discussed in this section.

\subsection{Pair production of down-type heavy quarks ($b^\prime$)}
The first signal process is based on the hypothesis that a fourth
generation of fermions may extend the particle content of the
SM~\cite{Holdom:2006mr}. Direct Higgs searches combining the search
channels $\gamma \gamma$, $ZZ$, $WW$, $b\bar{b}$, and $\tau^{+}
\tau^{-}$ disfavor a sequential fourth
generation~\cite{Eberhardt:2012gv,Djouadi:2012ae,Eberhardt:2012sb,Eberhardt:2012ck}
as the model predicts a specific hierarchy of signal strengths which
is not supported by the experimental results: while Higgs production
cross section in gluon-gluon fusion at the Tevatron and LHC is
enhanced by about a factor of nine for a Higgs boson mass of 126 GeV,
associated Higgs production ($HW$ and $HZ$) relevant for searching for
$H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ does not get such an enhancement factor from
the presence of fourth generation. However, the Higgs decay branching fraction
to $\gamma \gamma$ is heavily suppressed in a sequential fourth
generation model and can even over-compensate the gluon-gluon fusion
enhancement factor. Moreover, all Higgs branching fractions can be suppressed by
a common reduction factor by adjusting the heavy neutrino mass of the
fourth generation Dirac neutrino so that invisible Higgs decays become
possible. Additionally a fourth generation extension might still be in accordance
with experimental constraints when extending the Higgs sector, like in
Two-Higgs-Doublet models~\cite{BarShalom:2012ms}.

Electroweak precision observables favour the region $m_{t^\prime}>m_{b^\prime}$ 
(although $m_{t^\prime}<m_{b^\prime}$ is not excluded), with differences as large 
as $m_{t^\prime}-m_{b^\prime}=m_{W}$ being disfavoured. In the scenario studied in this
note, the $b^\prime$ can not decay into a $t^\prime$ and decays into the 
final states $u/c+W^{-}$ as well as $t+W^{-}$, as long as $m_{b^\prime}-m_{t}> m_W$, which is equivalent 
to $m_{b^\prime} > 255 \GeV{}$. If one assumes $V_{u(c) b^\prime}\ll V_{t b^\prime}$ the dominant decay is 
$b^\prime \rightarrow t+ W^{-}$. In this case it is possible to search for $b^\prime$ 
quarks by looking for pairs of same-sign charged leptons accompanied by a large number of jets,
two of them arising from $b$ quarks, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{feynman_bprime}.

\subsection{Single and pair production of heavy top quark partners ($T_{5/3}$)}
The second signal process is based on a model where the Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone 
boson~\cite{Contino:2008hi}. This natural, non-supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy 
problem requires fermionic partners of the top quark. 
These heavy fermions are coupled to the SM quarks through a $W$ boson,
preferentially to the third generation.
We study here the pair (Figure~\ref{feynman_t53pair}) and single (Figure~\ref{feynman_t53single}) 
productions of the top partners with electric charge $Q_{e}=5/3$, denoted $T_{5/3}$. It must be
noted that the pair production is kinematically equivalent to the pair production
of $b^\prime$ heavy quarks, and therefore the production cross sections are the same
for a given $b^\prime$ or $T_{5/3}$ mass. For the single production, the production 
cross section depends on the coupling constant $\lambda$ of the t$WT_{5/3}$ vertex.
In this analysis, we study the cases $\lambda=1$, $\lambda=3$ and $\lambda\ll 1$. In the
latter case, the single production vanishes and the study corresponds to the pair production
of $b^\prime$ quarks. 
Other top partners predicted in~\cite{Contino:2008hi}, such as $T_{2/3} \rightarrow Zt$, would slightly 
increase the number of expected signal events. Their contribution has
not been taken into account here.

\subsection{Production of events containing four top quarks}
The third and last signal process is the production of events containing four top quarks ($t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$). 
Indeed, many new physics models couple strongly to the top quark, including a new interaction 
related to electroweak symmetry breaking that couples uniquely to the top quark,
models where only the top quark is composite, 
or new coloured heavy particles that decay preferentially
to top quarks. Many of these new physics models predict an enhanced rate
of events containing four top quarks with respect to the SM production, which is of the order of 1~fb 
at 7~\TeV. Therefore, searching for events containing four top quarks could open
a window on new physics phenomena which do not affect $t\bar{t}$ production, for which
no deviation from the SM expectations has been observed so far.

This analysis follows the approach described in Ref.~\cite{Degrande:2010kt}, which consists of searching 
for the experimental signature of a four right-handed top quark contact interaction 
(Figure~\ref{feynman_4t}). Only the contact interaction operator with right-handed top quarks 
is considered, as left-handed top operators are already strongly constrained by electroweak precision 
data \cite{PhysRevD.51.3888}. This analysis therefore does not aim at testing a particular theory 
but rather a class of theories where new physics manifests itself at low energy as a four right-handed 
top contact interaction. This is the case for theories predicting new heavy vector particles strongly 
coupled to the right-handed top quark such as top 
compositeness~\cite{PhysRevD.78.074026,1126-6708-2008-04-087,1126-6708-2009-05-022} or 
Randall-Sundrum theories~\cite{Guchait:2007jd}.

\subsection{Data and Monte Carlo samples}\label{sect:samples}

\subsection{Data sample}
The data used in this search were collected by the ATLAS detector~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003} 
at the CERN LHC in 2011, using an
unprescaled single electron or muon trigger. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
$4.7\pm0.2~\ifb{}$~\cite{Aad:2011dr,ATLAS-CONF-2011-116}.

\subsection{Monte Carlo samples}\label{sect:MCsamples}
Monte Carlo simulation samples have been used to develop and validate the analysis procedures,
calculate the acceptance for signal events and to evaluate the contributions from some background
processes. The ATLAS software uses {\sc Geant4}~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh} 
to simulate the detector response~\cite{Aad:2010ah}. Unless explicitely stated,
all simulated samples were generated with the {\sc Cteq6l1}~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw} parton distribution 
functions (PDF).
The generation of simulated samples includes the effect of multiple $pp$ interactions per bunch
crossing. Events are reweighted so that the distribution of the number of $pp$ collisions occurring
in addition to the hard scatter process matches that in data.

The generation of signal events for the $b^\prime$ search has been done at leading-order (LO) with
{\sc Pythia 6.425}~\cite{PYTHIA6.4} and the LO$^{**}$ PDF~\cite{Sherstnev:2008dm}.
The main production mode is through the dominant lowest order
$gg$ and $q\bar{q}$ interactions, and the heavy $b^\prime$ are produced in pairs, for different
mass values, in the range 300-800~\GeV{} in steps of 50~\GeV{}. 
The corresponding cross sections have been rescaled to the ones calculated 
using {\sc Hathor} 1.2~\cite{Aliev:2010zk} to approximate next-to-next-to leading 
order (NNLO).

The single production of $T_{5/3}$ was simulated at LO using {\sc MadGraph}~4~\cite{Alwall:2007st} and hadronized with 
{\sc Pythia}~\cite{PYTHIA6.4} (as this model is not implemented in
{\sc MadGraph} we used a custom implementation). Samples with two different
values of the coupling constant $(\lambda=1,3$)\footnote{This study is limited to two 
values: $\lambda=1$ because it is the natural coupling value, and $\lambda=3$ because it is the most
pertinent value for theorists to test top compositeness.} have been generated with
masses in the range 450-750~\GeV{}, in steps of 100~\GeV{}. In order to reduce
the time needed to simulate these large Monte Carlo samples, a fast detector simulation has been used for
the $T_{5/3}$ samples to replace the {\sc Geant4}-based full simulation. 
The fast simulation used is {\sc AtlFastII}~\cite{Richter-Was:683751}, which employs 
{\sc FastCaloSim}~\cite{Yamanaka:1322202} for the
simulation of electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the calorimeter.

The {\sc MadGraph} 5 model used for the generation of four top quarks events has been provided by 
the authors of Ref.~\cite{Degrande:2010kt}. In this model, the contact interaction is not directly implemented. 
Instead, a new heavy colorless vector particle ($\rho$) coupling to the right-handed top quark is introduced. 
This model has two parameters in addition to those in the SM: the coupling constant between 
the top quark and $\rho$ ($g_\rho$), and the mass of $\rho$ ($m_\rho$). The values of the two new
parameters are arbitrary, provided that $m_\rho$ is sufficiently large to be in the contact interaction 
regime. The values used in this analysis are the same as the ones used in \cite{Degrande:2010kt}: 
$g_\rho=100\sqrt{8\pi}$ and $m_\rho=100$~TeV. The production cross section computed by {\sc MadGraph} 
using these values is 12.6~fb. Note that only the cross section depends on the parameters, while
the event kinematics do not, as long as the parameters leave the model in the contact interaction regime.

Several background processes contribute to the final state of same-sign dileptons with associated jets.
The largest backgrounds --- including top-quark pair production, $W+$jets and single top quark production ---
are estimated from data, as described in detail below (thereafter referred to as ``data-driven''). Additional
background estimates are derived using simulated Monte Carlo samples as listed here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Di-boson production:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $WZ$ and $ZZ$ were generated at LO using {\sc Alpgen} 2.13~\cite{Mangano:2002ea}, accounting for 
    hard emission of up to three partons, and {\sc Herwig} 6.52~\cite{COR-0001} together with
    {\sc Jimmy} 4.31~\cite{JButterworth:1996zw} to describe the 
    soft emission, showering and hadronization. Cross sections are 
    normalized to next-to-leading-order (NLO) theoretical calculations using 
    {\sc MC@NLO} 3.41~\cite{Frixione:2002ik};
  \item $W\gamma$, with hard emission of up to five partons, was also generated using {\sc Alpgen} and 
    {\sc Herwig/Jimmy};
  \item $W^{\pm}W^{\pm}$+2 jets was generated at LO with {\sc MadGraph} 4.4, 
    showered and hadronized with
    {\sc Pythia}. The cross section calculated by {\sc MadGraph} is not rescaled;
  \end{itemize} 
\item $t\bar{t}W$(+jet), $t\bar{t}Z$(+jet) and $t\bar{t}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}$ were generated at LO with
  {\sc MadGraph} 5.1.3, 
  showered and hadronized with {\sc Pythia}. Cross sections for the $t\bar{t}W/Z$(+jet)
  are rescaled to NLO calculations~\cite{Campbell:2012dh,Garzelli:2011is}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Object reconstruction}\label{sect:objects}
From the various signals recorded in the ATLAS detector after the $pp$ collision, we reconstruct
physics objects that are candidates for jets, electrons and muons. The primary vertex is defined
as the vertex with the highest summed track $\pT^2$, each having $\pT>0.4 \GeV{}$.

Jets are reconstucted in the calorimeter using the anti-$k_t$~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} algorithm with
a distance parameter of 0.4. Jets are required to satisfy $\pt>25 \GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.5$. They are
calibrated to the hadronic energy scale using $\pt$- and $\eta$-dependent corrections derived from
collision and test-beam data as well as simulation~\cite{Aad:2011he}. To reject jets from pileup, 
a quantity called jet-vertex-fraction, $JVF$, is defined as the ratio of the sum
of the $\pt$ of all tracks, with $\pt>0.4~\GeV{}$, within the jet that originate from the primary 
vertex associated to the hard-scattering collision, over the sum of the $\pt$ of all tracks 
matched to the jet. Jets with associated tracks are required to have $JVF>0.75$; we also
accept jets without any associated tracks. In order to avoid reconstructing electrons as jets,
the latter are required to have an angular separation 
$\Delta R(\mathrm{jet},e)$\footnote{$\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^2+\Delta\phi^2}$ is the distance 
between two objects, in
the plane $\eta-\phi$, where $\eta$ is the pseudo-rapidity and $\phi$ the angle in the transverse
plane.} of at least 0.2.

Jets from the decay of heavy flavor hadrons are selected by a multivariate $b$-tagging 
algorithm~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2012-043} at an operating point of 70\% efficiency for $b$-jets, which
corresponds to a
mis-tag rate of less than 1\%, as determined in simulated $t\bar{t}$ events.

Electrons are required to have a shower shape in the electromagnetic calorimeter consistent with
expectation, as well as a good quality track pointing to the cluster in the calorimeter.
Candidate electrons with transverse energy $\ET>25 \GeV$ are required to pass the ``tight''
ATLAS electron quality cuts~\cite{Aad:2011mk}, and to fall inside a well instrumented region
of the detector ($|\eta_\mathrm{cluster}|<2.47$, excluding $1.37<|\eta_\mathrm{cluster}|<1.52$). 
In addition, \ET{} and $\eta_\mathrm{cluster}$ dependent isolation cuts are imposed on the transverse 
energy in a cone of $\Delta R = 0.2$ around the electron ($\ET^{\Delta R=0.2}$) and on the total 
transverse momentum of all tracks within $\Delta R = 0.3$ of the electron ($\pT^{\Delta R=0.3}$).
The cuts are chosen such that the efficiency of each isolation requirement is 90\%. The values used
in the cuts range from 1.4~\GeV{} to 3.7~\GeV{} for $\ET^{\Delta R=0.2}$ and from 1~\GeV{} to 1.05~\GeV{}
for $\pT^{\Delta R=0.3}$. Electrons are also required to be well 
isolated from jets ($\Delta R(e,\mathrm{jet})>0.4$).

Muons are required to have transverse momentum $\pt>20 \GeV$, to pass standard ATLAS muon quality
cuts~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2011-063}, to be well measured in both the inner detector and the muon 
spectrometer and to fall within $|\eta|<2.5$. In addition, isolation cuts require the transverse energy 
within a cone of $\Delta R = 0.2$ and the total transverse momentum of all tracks within $\Delta R = 0.3$
of the muon candidate to be less than 4~\GeV{} and 2.5~\GeV{}, respectively. 
Muons are also required to be well isolated from jets ($\Delta R(\mu,\mathrm{jet})>0.4$).
Events that contain two muons which could originate from a cosmic muon passing
through the center of the detector are rejected, when the angle between them in the transverse plane
is larger than 3.1~rad. Events are also rejected if there is a candidate electron that shares a track
with a candidate muon.

The missing transverse momentum (denoted \met{}) is calculated using calorimeter clusters and corrected
for the presence of electrons, muons and jets~\cite{Aad:2012re}.

\subsection{Event selection}\label{sect:selection}
All events used in the analysis are required to have a primary vertex
determined from at least five tracks.
Events in the signal region are selected with the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events must contain at least two isolated leptons of the same charge. In events with more than one
  same-sign pair, the pairs are sorted according to the leading lepton
  \pT, then by the subleading lepton \pT. The first pair is chosen. An additional cut
  is performed on the leading lepton of the pair, requiring it to have \pT\ $>25$ \GeV{}. At this
  stage, each event is categorized as being a $ee$, $e\mu$ or $\mu\mu$ candidate, depending on the
  selected lepton flavors. At least one of the selected leptons must match the one that triggered
  the readout of the event.
\item Events must contain at least two jets, including at least one $b$-tagged jet.
\item In the $ee$ or $\mu\mu$ channel, the invariant mass of the two selected leptons must exceed 15 \GeV{} and be out of the $Z$-boson mass window; i.e. $|m_{\ell\ell} - m_Z| > 10 \GeV$.
\item The \met{} must be greater than 40 \GeV{}.
\item The \HT{}, defined as the scalar sum of the \pt\  of all leptons and jets, must exceed 550 \GeV{}.
\end{itemize}
These selection criteria are the result of an optimization, performed separately for the three different
signals, varying the requirements on \HT{}, on the number of jets and on the number of $b$-jets.
Finally, a common selection has been defined. The final acceptance for the different
signals is shown in Table~\ref{effsignal}.

\subsection{Standard Model backgrounds}\label{sect:back}
Several SM processes can mimic or produce final states with two same-sign leptons. 
These processes can be divided into two categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Irreducible background: SM processes with real same-sign dilepton pairs and
several jets, 
including $WZ$+jets, $ZZ$+jets, $W^{\pm}W^{\pm}$+2 jets, $t\bar{t}W$(+jet), $t\bar{t}Z$(+jet) and
$t\bar{t}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}$. Their contribution is estimated from Monte Carlo simulation
(see Section~\ref{sect:MCsamples}).
\item False same-sign dilepton pairs from:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item charge mis-identification: the sign of the electric charge of one of the two leptons in the 
    selected same-sign pair has been mis-reconstructed, leading a true opposite-sign lepton pair
    to be reconstructed as a same-sign pair.
    This background is labelled as ``mis-id''.
  \item mis-reconstructed leptons: at least one of the two leptons in the selected same-sign pair is not
    a real isolated lepton but has been reconstructed as such. This background is labelled as ``fakes''.
  \end{itemize}
  These two sources of false same-sign dilepton pairs are estimated using data-driven
  techniques, as explained in Sections~\ref{sect:misid} and~\ref{sect:fakes}.
\end{itemize}
SM processes producing two real leptons of opposite electric charge --- including 
$t\bar{t}$ production, single top quark production, $W^{\pm}W^{\mp}$+jets --- will contribute
to the false same-sign dilepton backgrounds and therefore are not included as Monte Carlo samples.
Monte Carlo studies show that the background from $W\gamma$+jets is negligible, therefore
this background will not be taken into account in the rest of the analysis.

\subsection{Background from charge mis-identification}\label{sect:misid}
In some events, a pair of opposite-sign leptons are produced and may be reconstructed as a
pair of same-sign leptons, if the charge of one of the leptons is mis-identified.

This background comes from two main sources: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
incorrect measurement of the sign of the track curvature; this effect is dominant at small curvature corresponding to high transverse momentum.
\item 
hard bremsstrahlung producing trident electrons 
($e^{\pm} \rightarrow e^{\pm}\gamma^{*} \rightarrow e^{\pm}e^{+}e^{-}$) for which the energy 
cluster is assigned to the wrong track, leading to a mis-identification of the charge. This
effect represents 90\% of the charge mis-identification contribution.
\end{itemize}
The rate of charge mis-identification for muons is only affected by
the first source, but has been measured to be negligible compared to
other backgrounds.

\caption{Charge mis-identification rate as a function of the electron $|\eta|$ (a).
    Invariant mass distribution for same-sign and reweighted opposite-sign events around the $Z$-peak (b).}
\end{figure}

The rate of charge mis-identification for electrons,
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{mis-id}}$, is derived as a function of the electron $|\eta|$
from the rate of same-sign and opposite-sign electron pairs in data
events from $Z$ bosons with $m_{ee} \in [81, 101] \GeV$. The variation of this rate as a 
function of \pT{} is much smaller than the variation with $\eta$, so is neglected in 
the parameterization of the the rate. The charge mis-id rate has been
calculated with three different methods: tag-and-probe, direct
extraction and likelihood. In the tag-and-probe method, the tag
electron is required to be within $|\eta| < 0.8$, and the probe electron
sign is looked at. In the direct extraction method,
both the tag and probe electrons are required to be in the same
$|\eta|$ range. Finally, in the likelihood method, all electron pairs
are examined: a likelihood function is built as a function of the observed numbers of
opposite-sign and same-sign events for each bin in a two-dimensional grid in $|\eta|$ (for both
electrons), and of
the unknown rates $\epsilon_{\mathrm{mis-id}}(|\eta|)$.
The minimization of this likelihood allows the charge mis-identification rate in each
$\eta$ bin to be extracted.
The values of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{mis-id}}$ as a
function of $|\eta|$ are shown in Figure~\ref{misid:rates}.

A closure test is performed by comparing the numbers of events selected in the $Z$-peak 
region using same-sign electron pairs (5143 events), and 
opposite-sign electron pairs reweighted by the mis-id weight. These distributions are presented
in Figure~\ref{misid:closure}. The likelihood method gives the best agreement with the 
same-sign rate: 5000 events,
while the direct extraction and tag-and-probe methods give higher 
and lower rates on average, 5500 and 3700 events respectively.
These differences are understood as arising from the different kinematic requirements
in the three methods. 
Therefore, the nominal estimate is done using the likelihood method, and the two other methods are
used for the systematic uncertainty determination. In this closure test,
the $Z$-peak for same-sign electrons is shifted to lower values with respect 
to opposite-sign electrons because a larger momentum fraction has been radiated for the same-sign case,
due to trident electrons.

The nominal charge mis-identification rate is then applied to data events passing the full signal 
selection but requiring an opposite-sign $e^+e^-$ or 
$e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}$ pair, to estimate the charge mis-identification contribution to the same-sign sample.

\subsection{Backgrounds with leptons originating from jets or photons}\label{sect:fakes}
The largest SM background source is from events with at least one ``fake'' lepton,
in addition to any number of ``real'' leptons that come from the decay of a $W$ or $Z$ boson.
The fake leptons may come from the semi-leptonic decay of a $b$ or $c$ hadron,
falsely identified as an isolated lepton, or $\pi^0$ or photons mis-reconstructed as leptons.

To estimate this background, two sets of lepton selection criteria are defined, named 
{\it loose} and {\it tight}. The probabilities $r$ and $f$ that a real or fake {\it loose} lepton 
passes the {\it tight} criteria are measured using purified control regions and they depend on the
characteristics of the event.
The matrix method~\cite{Aad:2010ey,Theveneaux-Pelzer:1476909} is then used to estimate the number 
of events in the signal region with at least one fake lepton.

The {\it tight} lepton definitions are the ones used in the standard selection described in
Section~\ref{sect:selection}. 
The {\it loose} electron selection is equivalent to the {\it tight} 
electron selection with the isolation requirement replaced by a looser cut. The {\it loose} muon selection
is equivalent to the {\it tight} muon selection with the isolation requirement removed. We define an
{\it anti-tight} lepton as being an exclusively {\it loose} lepton, i.e. required not to be {\it tight}.


The number of events that contain
two {\it tight} leptons is denoted $N_{TT}$. The number of events with one {\it tight} and one 
{\it anti-tight} is denoted $N_{TA}$ or $N_{AT}$, distinguished by $p_T$-ordering.
Similarly, the two {\it anti-tight} lepton count is referred to as $N_{AA}$. The total number of
events with two {\it loose} leptons is therefore $N^{ll}=N_{TT}+N_{TA}+N_{AT}+N_{AA}$.

$N_{RR}^{ll}$ is the number of events that contain two real leptons, the number of events with one 
real and one fake leptons is denoted $N_{RF}^{ll}$ or $N_{FR}^{ll}$ depending on the $\pt$ of the 
leptons, and the number for two fake leptons is $N_{FF}^{ll}$. The total number of events with
two {\it loose} leptons is therefore
$N^{ll}=N_{RR}^{ll}+N_{RF}^{ll}+N_{FR}^{ll}+N_{FF}^{ll}$.
These numbers are unknown.

The number of events with two {\it tight} leptons, our signal region sample, can be written as
$N_{TT}=N_{RR}^{tt}+N_{RF}^{tt}+N_{FR}^{tt}+N_{FF}^{tt}$ and the final fake estimation is
$N_{TT}^{\mathrm{fakes}}=r_1 f_2 N_{RF}^{ll}+f_1 r_2 N_{FR}^{ll}+f_1 f_2 N_{FF}^{ll}$, where $r_1$ and $f_1$
are the probabilities for the first lepton, and $r_2$ and $f_2$ for the second lepton.

Linear expressions are obtained for the observed yields $N_{TT,TA,AT,AA}$ as a function 
of the unknown numbers $N_{RR,RF,FR,FF}^{ll}$ and the measured rates $r$ and $f$. 
These linear expressions form a 
matrix that is inverted to extract the real and fake content of the selected dilepton event sample:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} N_{TT} \\ N_{TA} \\ N_{AT} \\ N_{AA} \\ \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}  r_1 r_2        & r_1 f_2       & f_1 r_2        & f_1 f_2         \\
    r_1 (1-r_2)     & r_1 (1-f_2)     & f_1 (1-r_2)     & f_1 (1-f_2)     \\
    (1-r_1)r_2    & (1-r_1)f_2     & (1-f_1)r_2     & (1-f_1)f_2     \\
    (1-r_1)(1-r_2) & (1-r_1)(1-f_2) & (1-f_1)(1-r_2) & (1-f_1)(1-f_2) \\             
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} N_{RR}^{ll} \\ N_{RF}^{ll} \\ N_{FR}^{ll} \\ N_{FF}^{ll} \\ \end{bmatrix}
  \label{matrice}
\end{equation}

The value of $r$ was determined with a tag-and-probe method on 
$Z \rightarrow e^+e^-/\mu^+\mu^-$ events where the overlap removal between leptons and jets (see 
Section~\ref{sect:selection}) is applied with {\it loose} leptons.

The value of $f$ for fake electrons is estimated in a sample with at least one jet and exactly one 
{\it loose} electron, 
with a cut on the distance between the leading jet and the lepton, with the overlap 
removal performed with {\it loose} electrons, and with $\met{}<20 \GeV$ in order to 
enrich the sample in multijets.

The value of $f$ for fake muons was determined from data for events with one {\it loose} muon and
in a low transverse $W$ mass region, with an 
inverted triangular cut: $m_T(W)<20 \GeV$ and $\met{}+m_T(W)<60 \GeV$. 

To measure the yield of events with at least one fake lepton, 
we use the same cuts as the full analysis but ask for 
{\it loose} leptons instead of {\it tight} leptons. These events are weighted with a weight that depends
on some kinematic variables: the weights for electrons 
are parametrized versus $|\eta|$ and \pt{}, while for muons they are parametrized in muon 
$|\eta|$ and \pt{} of the leading jet in order to account for dependencies on muon detector acceptance and 
hadronic activity from hard jets affecting the muon isolation.

Trident electrons have a smaller probability to pass the {\it tight} selection than normal electrons, 
thus a fraction of trident electrons will be included in the fake lepton estimate from the matrix method.
We therefore estimate and remove this double-counting by applying the matrix method to the same-sign
events with a dilepton mass inside
the $Z$-peak, dominated by trident electrons. This estimate results in 22\% of mis-id events that
are captured as fake background: we scale the estimated charge mis-identification 
contribution down by 78\% to remove the overlap between the two estimates.

\subsection{Background control regions}
To validate the modeling of the SM backgrounds, several control regions are
examined. Control regions are orthogonal to the signal region and defined by selections that
suppress possible signal contributions.

The main control region inverts the \HT{} selection by requiring $\HT{} \in [100,500] \GeV$ and
does not include the cut on \met{}, in order to increase the number of events.

For the main control region, 
the predicted number of background events, including only the dominant systematic
uncertainties --- production cross sections for the Monte Carlo samples and global systematic
uncertainties on the data-driven backgrounds as explained in Section~\ref{sect:syst} --- are
shown in Table~\ref{ctrl:ht2j_yield}, as well as the observed number of events in the data.
Expected and observed numbers agree within uncertainties. The expected numbers of events from
two examples of signals are also shown in Table~\ref{ctrl:ht2j_yield} and are found to be
negligible in this control region.


As the main control region concentrates on the low
\HT{} region, a second control region, with high \HT{}, is defined.
The second control region requires at least one $b$-jet 
(and no other requirement on the number of jets), 
$\HT>400 \GeV$ and $\met<40 \GeV$ in order to be
orthogonal to our signal region. The resulting number of events can be seen in Table~\ref{ctrl:met_yield}
and shows good agreement within the very low statistics.

\subsection{Systematic uncertainties}\label{sect:syst}
Several systematic uncertainties have been considered, and their estimates are summarized below.

\subsection{Uncertainties affecting the Monte Carlo samples}
Uncertainties in the jet and lepton efficiency,
energy or momentum calibration, and resolution lead to systematic uncertainties on the signal
and background acceptance. Their effect is evaluated by varying each parameter independently
within its uncertainty and recomputing the yield of each sample.

The uncertainty on the luminosity has been estimated from van der Meer 
scans and is 3.9\%~\cite{Aad:2011dr,ATLAS-CONF-2011-116}. 
Uncertainties on Monte Carlo background cross sections depend on the process:
30\% for the $t\bar{t}W$(+jet) sample, 34\% for the $WZ$ and $ZZ$ samples,
$+35$\% and $-24$\% for the $t\bar{t}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}$ sample, and
50\% for the $W^{\pm}W^{\pm}$+2 jets
and $t\bar{t}Z$(+jet) samples. They are the largest systematic uncertainties for the
backgrounds estimated from simulation.

\subsection{Uncertainties affecting the data-driven backgrounds}

The uncertainty on the overall scale of the charge mis-identification background in the signal region 
is derived  from a comparison of the mis-id rate extracted by the three different methods already
discussed. Based on this comparison, an overall uncertainty of 12\% is attributed to the mis-id background.

Uncertainties on the estimate of background coming from fake leptons are 50\% for the $ee$ 
channel, 40\% for the $e\mu$ channel, and 30\% for the $\mu\mu$ channel.
For the electron case, the uncertainty was estimated by using different {\it loose} electron 
definitions. For the muon case, it was estimated by changing the definition of the multijet 
enriched region, and using the number of jets, instead of the leading jet \pT{}, for the
weight parametrization.

\subsection{Results}\label{sect:results}
After applying the selection to the data, we find four events in the signal region, with $5.6\pm1.7$ 
expected background events. The details of the observed number of events are shown in 
Table~\ref{finalyield}, as well as the total expected number of background events. 
No significant excess is observed in the data, 
therefore limits on the signals are computed in the following section.

\subsection{Interpretation of the results}\label{sect:interpretation}
For each model, upper limits at 95\% C.L. on the cross sections of the hypothetical
processes are derived using the $CL_S$ method~\cite{Junk:1999kv,0954-3899-28-10-313}. We use
single-bin counting experiments to extract the most likely signal cross section.
Systematic uncertainties are included as variations in the expected signal and background
yields, which are allowed to vary in the ensembles used to generate the $CL_S$ distributions.
Correlations of the systematic uncertainties across samples and channels are taken into account. 
It must also be noted that each sample is statistically varied independently, using a Gaussian function
truncated at zero\footnote{A cross-check was done replacing the truncated Gaussian function by a 
log-normal distribution and the results are very similar.}, in order to avoid negative contributions, 
in particular for the samples which have a very low yield and a large statistical uncertainty.

\subsection{Pair production of $b^\prime$ and $T_{5/3}$}
The 95\% C.L. upper limits on the production cross sections of a pair of $b^\prime$ or $T_{5/3}$ 
are extracted
for each hypothesis of mass of the new particle. Comparing these limits to the predicted cross section
as a function of the mass, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{limit:bprime}, we set a lower limit of 
0.67~\TeV{} on the mass of the $b^\prime$ quark and of the $T_{5/3}$ in the case $\lambda\ll1$, with an
expected limit of 0.64~\TeV{}.

        at 95\% C.L.}
    \label{limit:t53}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Single and pair production of the $T_{5/3}$}
For the two cases $\lambda=1$ and $\lambda=3$, both the single and pair production of the $T_{5/3}$
must be included. The 95\% C.L. upper limits on the production cross sections are used to
derive lower limits on the mass of the $T_{5/3}$ at 0.68~\TeV{} for $\lambda=1$ and 0.70~\TeV{} for
$\lambda=3$, with expected limits of 0.64~\TeV{} and 0.66~\TeV{}, respectively. These results, combined with
the pair production result, are summarized in Figure~\ref{limit:t53}.

\subsection{Four top quarks production}
An upper limit
at 95\% C.L. of 61~fb is derived for the production cross section of four top quarks events
through a contact interaction, with an expected limit of 90~fb.
This result can be extrapolated to other models, as long as the kinematical properties of the 
produced events are similar to the ones generated by the four-top quark contact interaction. In
particular, a study at parton level of SM four-top quark events has shown that the
global acceptance of this SM signal is only about 15\% lower than the acceptance
for the four top quarks signal considered in this analysis. Therefore, one can set an upper limit on the
SM four top quarks production of the same order of magnitude.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{sect:conclusion}
In conclusion, a search for exotic processes in the same-sign dilepton plus jets signature with the
ATLAS detector at LHC at $\sqrt{s}=7 \TeV$
has been presented. The events are selected by requiring at least two jets, including at
least one $b$-tagged jet, $\met>40 \GeV$ and $\HT>550 \GeV$, with \HT{} being the scalar sum of the \pT{}
of all leptons and jets. The full 2011 ATLAS $pp$ dataset,
corresponding to 4.7~\ifb{}, was used in this search. Four events have been observed with an expected
background of $5.6\pm1.7$ events. This result has been interpreted in terms of the pair production 
of down-type heavy quarks ($b^\prime$), the single and pair production of heavy quark partners
($T_{5/3}$), and the production of events containing four top quarks through a four-top quark
contact interaction. The various limits which have been set are summarized in Table~\ref{limit:all}.

The obtained limit on the $b^\prime$ and $T_{5/3}$ mass in the pair production is the most stringent 
limit to date in the same-sign dilepton channel. The limits obtained on the $T_{5/3}$ including the
single production, and on four top quark event production are the first results on these signals.
