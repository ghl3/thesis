This thesis would not have been possible without the help of many people.
I would like to primarily acknowledge the excellent mentoring of Kyle Cranmer, who has served as my thesis advisor for my graduate school carreer.
In addition, I would like to thank Allen Mincer and Peter Nemethy for for their guidance, advice, and help throughout my time at New York University.
I am indebeted to Akira Shibata for teaching me particle physics, computer programming, and for being an excellent example of a productive and successful scientist.
I would also like acknowledge Jonathan Zrake for always being available for a discussion, either long or short.
And I would also like to thank Dan Foreman-Mackey for helping to open up the world of computer science to me.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and the rest of my extended family for their continual support
